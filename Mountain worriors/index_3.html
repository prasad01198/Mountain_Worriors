                Ahivant Fort, also known as Ahivantgad, is a lesser-known fort located near Nashik in the state of
                Maharashtra, India. It is situated in the Sahyadri mountain range and offers breathtaking views of the
                surrounding landscape. Ahivant Fort holds historical and cultural significance, and it can be a great
                destination for trekkers and history enthusiasts.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                In 1636 this fort was under the control of Adilshah. The Moghul Emperor Shahjahan send one of his
                General Shaista Khan and entrusted to win all the forts in Nashik region. Alivardi khan was cavalier of
                Shaista Khan who won the Fort. In 1670 Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj won the fort from Moghuls. The Moghul
                Emperor Aurangzeb sent his chieftain Mahabat Khan to win the fort. Mahabat Khan and Diler Khan opened
                battle front from either side of the fort. The attack was so fierce that the fort was surrendered to
                Moghuls. In 1818 the fort was captured by British Colonel Prother
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                The nearest town is Vani which is 44 km from Nashik. The base village of the fort is Daregaonwani which
                is 13km from Vani. There are good hotels at Vani. The trekking path starts from the hillock north of the
                Daregoanwani. The route is very safe and wide. There are no trees on the trekking route. It takes about
                two hours to reach the entrance gate of the fort. The night stay on the fort cannot be made due to lack
                of potable water on the fort. The villagers from the local village make night stay and food arrangements
                at a reasonable cost. The other route is from Village ahiwantwadi. This route is the shortest and safe.
                The motorable road from Daregaon towards Bilawadi helps to reach the col easily and from there a small
                climb for 1hr can reach the top of the fort.

                History
            </h4>
            <p class="lead" style="text-indent:55px">
                According to the Historical documents, in 1670, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj invaded Surat City.
                Chhatrapati
                Shivaji Maharaj was pursued by Daudkhan, a mutual commander for having sacked the city for the second
                time.
                Chhatrapati Shivaji was successfully able to do this as he secured the loot by keeping it in Kanchana
                fort
                with his two thousand soldiers.
            </p>

            <p class="lead" style="text-indent:55px">
                He ultimately defeated Dhaudkhan. The army of Shivaji has also captured the areas of proximity. These
                were
                Rawla-Jawla, Trymbakgad, Markandeya Fort, and Ahivant Fort.

                Much less history about this fort is known. This fort was surrendered to Captain Mackintosh in 1818
                after the garrison in the fort saw burning of the neighboring Rajdher fort
            </p>

            <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 55px;">
                The nearest town is Chandwad which is 69 km from Nashik. The base village of the fort is Indraiwadi
                which is 9 km from Chandwad. There are good hotels at Chandwad, now tea and snacks are also available in
                small hotels at Indraiwadi. The trekking path starts from the hillock south of the Indraiwadi village.
                The route is very safe and passes through dense scrubs. There is no marked path that leads to the fort.
                it is advisable to hire a local guide from the village. It takes about two hours to reach the scarp of
                the fort. a narrow path along the base of the scarp takes a northern detour to reach the rock-cut steps.
                The steps are 2m wide and 150 in number. It takes about 15 minutes to climb the steps. The entrance gate
                is nowhere seen. There is plenty of water available on the fort. The night stay on the fort can be made
                in the caves on the fort
